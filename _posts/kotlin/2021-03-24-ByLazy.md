If a property use huge resources when it's initialized or doesn't need to be initialized everytime, you could apply *Lazy Initialization* pattern.  
For example, ```Pizza``` class provide its dough. But it takes quite long time to make new dough. So let's get dough only once when use it for the first time.  
<br>
```kotlin
class Pizza() {
    private var _dough: Dough? = null   //Backing property of dough. It saves data.
    val dough: Dough
        get() {
            if(_dough == null) {
                _dough = getDough()    //get dough only when initial approach
            }
            return _dough!!    //if it has saved data, return the data.
        }
}
```
Yes. You don't need to write this whole code in Kotlin. Kotlin suggest ```lazy```.  
<br>
```kotlin
class Pizza() {
    val dough by lazy { getDough() }
}
```
```lazy``` internally delay initialization like above code. Moreover unlike the code above, it's thread-safety.
